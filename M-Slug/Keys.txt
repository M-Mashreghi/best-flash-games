Recomendations:
---------------

Certain Video cards force VSYNC if you use tripple buffering... this slows
down the emulation alot. If you have problems with speed turn tripple
buffering off.

If you have 60hz as refreshrate at res640x480 or res320x240
use tripple buffering with VSYNC and enable full 
throttle (press '9') to get the most steady frame rate.

Remember to try all the different options in Video menu to find out what 
works best on your hardware. And dont forget to checkout interpolation...


Known problems/todo list:
-------------------------

Linescrolling. Lack of this feature gives certain games gfx-glitches.

All games that don't have a preview picture on and are in the game list 
have some kind of defect either linescrolling or other bugs. The preview
pics are only included in the complete setup.

MAJOR sound optimisations is needed, we haven't optimised it at all. So its not
NeoRAGE speedy ;-). Exlude the ADPCM part.


Frequently Asked Questions/Troubleshooting:
-------------------------------------------

How do I overclock a certain game?
Type ,desired Hz after the game in the ini file. EX: 142096,metslug2.zip,20000000 
This will set the 68000 cpu to 20 Mhz and will also overclock the z80 the same
percentage. In some games timing is very important, in that case overclocking
can make the game unstable. We have already overclocked some games so you might
not see any difference if you dont overclock them even more.

Where do I have to put my neo-geo bios files?
You can have them either unpacked or in a zip-file named neogeo.zip. Put them in
the same directory as NeoRAGEx.exe or in either rompath1 or rompath2.

Where do I put my roms?
In either rompath1 or rompath2. You can define your own rompaths in the 
options/directories menu.

How could i enter the menu without exiting the game?
Hit TAB

How could i enter the Dipswitch settings menu?
There are 2 ways to do this:
1. You can use F1 to switch between Dipswitch menu directly. No need to go through
NeoRAGE menu at all.
2. Or Enter the machine settings from the main menu. Select MVS Settings=ON. Accept
changes and reset NeoRAGE. Now you can change the softdip settings as you like.
When you are done leave the softdip and enter the NeoRAGE Main Menu again. 
Change MVS-Settings=OFF and reset NeoRAGE.
Note! Remeber to leave the dip-menu before Pressing F1 or reseting.

What does the (?) mean in the gamelist?
It means that the game is not a tested dump. But propably will run ok anyway. It has
nothing to do with the name of the dump!
